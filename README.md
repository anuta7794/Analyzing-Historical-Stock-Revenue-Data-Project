# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-with-Python

This Project is a part of the "Python for Data Science, AI and Development" IBM course and aims to showcase web scraping skills in Python.

For this project, you assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job was to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data 
 visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

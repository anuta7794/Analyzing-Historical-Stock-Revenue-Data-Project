# Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data with Python

### Overview:

This Project is a part of the _"Python for Data Science, AI and Development"_ IBM course and aims to showcase **web scraping skills** in **Python**.

For this project, I assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job was to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I
visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with are **Tesla** and **GameStop**. As a data scientist working for a hedge fund, I extracted the profit data for Tesla and GameStop and built a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the profit for the hedge fund.

I used **Jupyter Notebook** to Complete this Project ([link](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Desktop/IBM%20Data%20Analyst/Python%20Project%20for%20Data%20Science/Analyzing%20Historical%20Stock_Revenue%20Data%20Project.ipynb)).
